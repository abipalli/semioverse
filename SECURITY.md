## Supported Versions

The current `master` branche is supported with security updates.

## Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure

The security of the semioverse requires requires strong collaboration with security researchers. If you believe that you have found a security bug in our code, we encourage you to report it. To report a bug, you can:

* Submit a report to the [semioverse vulnerability rewards program](https://hats.finance/), where it may be eligible for a reward. 

* Send an email to [security@semiover.se](mailto:security@semiover.se).

* It is important to be able to provide steps that reproduce the issue and demonstrate its impact with a Proof of Concept example in an initial bug report. Before reporting a bug, a reporter may want to have another trusted individual reproduce the issue.

* A bug reporter can expect acknowledgment of a potential vulnerability reported through  [security@semiover.se](mailto:security@semiover.se)  within one business day of submitting a report. If an acknowledgement of an issue is not received within this time frame, especially during a weekend or holiday period, please reach out again. Any issues reported to the [semioverse vulnerability rewards program](https://hats.finance/) will be acknowledged within the time frames posted on the program page.

* For the safety and security of those who depend on the code, bug reporters should avoid publicly sharing the details of a security bug on Twitter, Discord, Telegram, or in public Github issues during the coordination process.

* Once a vulnerability report has been received and triaged semioverse code maintainers will confirm whether it is valid, and will provide updates to the reporter on validity of the report.

* When the semioverse code mantainers have verified an issue, remediation steps and patch release timeline information will be shared with the reporter.
	* Complexity, severity, impact, and likelihood of exploitation are all vital factors that determine the amount of time required to remediate an issue and distribute a software patch.
	* If an issue is Critical or High Severity, semioverse code maintainers will release a security advisory to notify impacted parties to prepare for an emergency patch.
	* While the current industry standard for vulnerability coordination resolution is 90 days, semioverse code maintainers will strive to release a patch as quickly as possible.

When a bug patch is included in a software release, the semioverse code maintainers will:
	* Confirm the version and date of the software release with the reporter.
	* Provide information about the security issue that the software release resolves.
	* Credit the bug reporter for discovery by adding thanks in release notes, securing a CVE designation, or adding the researcherâ€™s name to a Hall of Fame.
