# Play!

Play! is an interfacing interface for distributed semiosis. It is an interface for navigating and transforming the semioverse. Peers in this network can connect and communicate, each running independent but interoperable games. The system can be viewed as a complex symbol system where symbols are not just being used but created and redefined continuously.

Each game represents a semiotic domain, a self-contained yet interoperable universe of meaning. Here, `Game` and `Play` serve as base classes for creating, interacting with, and sharing these semiotic domains.

The `Play` class, specifically, handles the networking aspect, joining and leaving the Hyperswarm network, handling connections, and passing data between connected peers. This can be seen as a distributed meaning-making system, where each peer can generate, share, and interpret symbols (or "expressions") within their own context, while also receiving and interpreting expressions from others.

With this architecture, semiotic interaction is not only happening within each game but also at the network level. The system is designed to handle any expression received from another peer and pass it to all its games, a process similar to the spread of memes or ideas within a social network.

There is also a narrative aspect to this code. The addition of narrative functions allows for the creation of stories or sequences of events within a game. These narratives could represent complex symbol or meaning sequences, and the ability to prioritize or disable these narratives could represent the focus of attention or the suppression of certain storylines or symbol sequences.

In the more abstract semiotic view, the system as a whole could be seen as a metaphor for how societies create, share, and transform meaning over time. Each peer might represent an individual or a group, and the narratives and expressions within their games represent the stories, symbols, and ideas they generate and live by. The networking between peers represents the communication and interaction within society, spreading, mixing, and transforming these ideas.

In terms of semiotics, this code can be seen as a system of signs, where each function name, method, and the objects they manipulate represent different components of meaning.

    **Card:** The Card class itself is a signifier, pointing to the concept of a card. Cards are typically symbolic of individual units of meaning within a larger system, like a deck of cards or a library catalog.

    **thread:** The thread method might be seen as the signifier for the concept of a path or a trajectory through the map of the card. This is quite symbolic, representing the journey of navigating through complex systems, pulling on a thread to unravel meaning, or connecting different points in a network. This function manipulates the Card to create a thread-like path, linking the different nodes in the constellation.

    **weave:** The weave method signifies the act of creating a complex system from individual threads, much like weaving a tapestry. This refers to the creation of intricate structures or narratives from individual, seemingly unconnected elements. The symbolic act here is one of integration and synthesis, of bringing together disparate parts to form a cohesive whole.

    **navigate:** The navigate method signifies movement through a system or network. It carries connotations of exploration, of discovery, and of plotting a course. It yields a new context each time it steps through the path, reinforcing the idea of a journey or voyage.

    **replace:** The replace method is a signifier for substitution or transformation. It's an act of exchange, replacing one signifier with another within the structure of the Card.

    Map: The use of Map and its extension to a Card creates another layer of meaning. Maps are traditionally used for navigation and for representing spatial relationships, here used to represent abstract relationships between objects in the card. The use of Map signifies interconnectedness, relationships, and networks.

The overall signified, or the concept that arises from all these signifiers, seems to be a dynamic system of meaning where individual units (Cards) are linked through paths (thread), creating a complex network (weave) that can be explored (navigate) and transformed (replace).

The code, therefore, can be seen as a semiotic system itself, as it uses signifiers (code and syntax) to point to signified concepts (the operations and structures the code creates). It's a language in itself, communicating ideas not just to the machine, but also to the humans reading and writing it.

The Card class, as defined here, creates a multi-dimensional, non-linear, interconnected network of nodes where every node (Card) itself can contain other nodes. This leads to an intricate web of relationships that are defined by both the keys and values of each Card.

Considering that the keys themselves can be Card instances, this adds a depth of complexity to the overall structure and function of the system. By permitting keys to be complex Card instances rather than simple identifiers, the system allows for metaphorical connections to be made.

In the context of semiotics, a metaphor involves using a signifier from one sign system to represent something in another system. Metaphors can bridge gaps between disparate concepts, making unfamiliar ideas more relatable and understandable. Using Card instances as keys essentially enables the system to function on multiple levels of abstraction simultaneously.

This design can accommodate an enormous range of applications and use-cases. For example, it could be used to model and navigate complex conceptual systems, such as a web of scientific knowledge or a network of social relations. It could also be used to create intricate game worlds, or to build a language parsing system that understands context and metaphor.

Also, because every Card is itself a Map (an ordered list of key-value pairs), it opens up possibilities for creating nuanced relationships and hierarchies within each Card. Cards can be woven together to create intricate structures, each Card a microcosm that reflects the complexity of the whole.

The replace method adds another layer of dynamism to the system. It allows for the transformation and evolution of the network by substituting one node with another along the defined routes. This could signify learning or growth in an AI system, evolution in a genetic algorithm, or simply the passage of time in a dynamic system.

The use of async functions and generators adds to this dynamism. Asynchronous operations allow the system to manage multiple threads of execution simultaneously, mirroring the complexity and unpredictability of real-world systems. The generator function used in navigate method allows for lazy evaluation, meaning that complex navigational paths can be computed on-the-fly, one step at a time, reducing the computational overhead and allowing for potentially infinite paths.

In conclusion, the Card class defined in this code represents an intricate, dynamic, and deeply interconnected system that could serve as a foundation for modeling a wide array of complex systems, from networks of human knowledge to evolving ecosystems. The possibility of using Card instances as keys, signifying metaphor, adds a degree of conceptual abstraction that could make this system incredibly powerful for bridging gaps between disparate systems or concepts.

The lambda calculus is a universal model of computation that uses function abstraction and application as primary operations. It treats functions as first-class citizens where they can be passed as arguments, returned as values from other functions, or assigned to variables. The basic operations of the lambda calculus involve defining an anonymous function and applying that function to arguments.

The concept of substitution in lambda calculus is fundamental to function application. When a function is applied to an argument, the formal parameter of the function is substituted by the actual argument in the function's body.

In S-expressions, which are a notation for nested list (tree-structured) data, invented for and popularized by the programming language Lisp, code and data are written in the same way - as expressions. Lisp and other languages following its paradigm treat code as data, allowing for powerful meta-programming constructs.

Let's relate the Card class functions with these concepts:

    Lambda calculus - function abstraction and application:

    The Card class itself can be thought of as an abstract function, with keys and values as its parameters. thread, weave, navigate and replace can be seen as applying these abstract functions.

    The replace function can be directly tied to the concept of substitution in the lambda calculus. It goes through the routes provided, navigates to the destination, and substitutes the existing Card at the destination with a new one with the specified value. It applies this 'substitution function' to each route.

    S-expressions:

    The Card class in a sense embodies the essence of S-expressions. Each Card is an instance of Map, which can be seen as a list with key-value pairs. This list can be nested to form a tree-like structure, akin to S-expressions. The Card's keys and values being both data and potential function applications make them analogous to S-expressions in Lisp and similar languages.

    Operation and Operand Graph:

    Each key in a Card can be seen as an operation that is applied to its values (operands). The values themselves can be Cards (operations), forming a potentially infinite operation-operand graph. This graph is navigated and manipulated with thread, weave, navigate and replace, resembling the computation process in lambda calculus and execution in Lisp-like languages.

---

The Card class, as defined here, is a structure that can be used to represent an operation-operand graph. In this context, operations can be considered as the keys in the Card and the operands as the corresponding values.

Let's demonstrate this by constructing an operation-operand graph for a mathematical operation using the Card class. Suppose we are trying to construct the mathematical operation 3 * (4 + 5) as a graph.

```javascript
// Initialize the root of the operation-operand graph
let root = new Card();

// Define the cards for numbers 3, 4 and 5.
let three = new Card();
three.set("value", 3);
let four = new Card();
four.set("value", 4);
let five = new Card();
five.set("value", 5);

// Define the cards for the "+" and "*" operations.
let add = new Card();
add.set("operation", "+")
let multiply = new Card();
add.set("operation", "*")

// Weave the operation-operand graph.
await root.thread(multiply);
await multiply.thread(three, add);
await add.thread(four, five);

```

In the above code:

    three, four, and five are Card instances that represent the numbers 3, 4, and 5, respectively.

    add and multiply are Card instances that represent the "+" and "*" operations, respectively.

    We create the operation-operand graph by threading the operations and operands together, starting from the root. The root Card threads into multiply, which then threads into three and add, and so forth.

This gives us a graph where each node is an operation (Card used as a key) and its operands (Card instances as values), allowing us to construct the 3 * (4 + 5) operation.

The navigate function could be used to traverse this operation-operand graph, and the replace function could be used to perform computation operations on this graph, substituting operation nodes with their results.

This way, using the Card class and its functions, we can model complex operation-operand structures as graphs, allowing for versatile and dynamic computational models. This opens up possibilities for things like graph-based computation, visual programming environments, and much more.

The Card class and its associated methods can lead to some exciting possibilities. Its design allows it to be flexible and versatile, making it a powerful tool in a variety of computational and semiotic contexts. Here are some possibilities:

    Graph-based Computation and Data Flow Programming: The Card class can be seen as a basic building block for a graph-based computation system. Complex operations can be broken down into simpler operations and represented as a graph of Card instances. The navigate function can be used to traverse this graph, essentially executing the operation. The replace function can perform substitutions in the graph, acting like computation in the data flow. This is akin to data flow programming where the focus is on the movement and transformation of data within the system.

    Visual Programming Environments: With its ability to model complex operation-operand structures as graphs, the Card class could be used as the basis for a visual programming environment. Each Card could be represented visually as a node, with threads between nodes representing the relationships between them. This could make programming more accessible and intuitive, especially for people who are new to coding.

    Semantic Web and Knowledge Graphs: The Card class's structure is ideally suited for creating knowledge graphs. Each Card could represent a concept, with the relationships between Card instances representing semantic relationships between concepts. This could be a powerful tool for creating a semantic web, allowing complex interrelated data to be represented and navigated easily.

    Metaphorical and Semantic Computing: The ability of the Card class to use other Card instances as keys opens up possibilities for metaphorical and semantic computing. This could allow for the creation of systems that can understand and reason with metaphors, opening up new possibilities in fields like natural language processing and artificial intelligence.

    Interactive Storytelling and Game Design: The Card class could be used to create interactive narratives or game worlds. Each Card could represent a scene, character, or object, with the relationships between cards defining the structure of the narrative or game world. This could allow for highly interactive and non-linear storytelling experiences.

    Modular and Expandable Software Design: With its thread, weave, navigate, and replace methods, the Card class provides a strong foundation for modular and expandable software design. New functionalities can be added by simply adding new Card instances and threading them appropriately.

    Systems Simulation: The multi-dimensional nature of the Card system provides a powerful structure for system simulations. It could be utilized to represent a range of systems from simple hierarchical structures to more complex nested systems. For example, in an ecological model, each Card could represent different ecological components—organisms, populations, communities, and so on—with their interconnectedness represented as threads between the cards.

    Modeling and Simulating Neural Networks: With the Card structure, you could potentially model a neural network, where each Card could represent a neuron, and the links between them could represent the synapses. The replace function could be used to adjust the weights of these synapses at run time.
