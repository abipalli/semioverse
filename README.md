# Play!

Play! is an interfacing interface for distributed semiosis, it is an interface for navigating and transforming the semioverse. Peers in this network can connect and communicate, each running independent but interoperable simulations. The system as can be viewed as a complex symbol system where symbols are not just being used but created and redefined continuously.

Each simulation, running on a peer, represents a semiotic domain, a self-contained yet interoperable universe of meaning. Here, `Simulation` and `Play` serve as base classes for creating, interacting with, and sharing these semiotic domains.

The `Play` class, specifically, handles the networking aspect, joining and leaving the Hyperswarm network, handling connections, and passing data between connected peers. This can be seen as a distributed meaning-making system, where each peer can generate, share, and interpret symbols (or "expressions") within their own context, while also receiving and interpreting expressions from others.

With this architecture, semiotic interaction is not only happening within each simulation but also at the network level. The system is designed to handle any expression received from another peer and pass it to all its simulations, a process similar to the spread of memes or ideas within a social network.

There is also a narrative aspect to this code. The addition of narrative functions allows for the creation of stories or sequences of events within a simulation. These narratives could represent complex symbol or meaning sequences, and the ability to prioritize or disable these narratives could represent the focus of attention or the suppression of certain storylines or symbol sequences.

In the more abstract semiotic view, the system as a whole could be seen as a metaphor for how societies create, share, and transform meaning over time. Each peer might represent an individual or a group, and the narratives and expressions within their simulations represent the stories, symbols, and ideas they generate and live by. The networking between peers represents the communication and interaction within society, spreading, mixing, and transforming these ideas.
