// common cards held between multiple plays
// each player holds a list of symmetries (mimetic mirror: only seeing myself in the other)
// message passing between plays
// coherence beacon:
// turning a story into a place: all those holding the current card-composition
// take the hash of this card and join a common space.
// but you can also hash an event.

// the distance in this space is given my resonance
// it's a digital interface into the noosphere.

// card-compositions are a card-graph/story-graph

// two kinds of cards

// It's a particular game:
// 1) cards can be shared
// 2) each card unlocks a space
// 3) you only see your own cards (=mimetic mirror)
// 4) you can compose cards (stories)
// 5) composed/accepted cards are broadcasted to a player's contact list of known input card holders.
